# Embedded Systems Development Project - Hiking Tour Assistant
## Project description
The projext implements a smartwatch UI for the LilyGo TWatch 2020,which allows the user to start and stop recording sessions and a web server for a Raspberry Pi for displaying the session statistics. During a hiking session travelled distance and step count are displayed and saved to the smartwatch. In addition, the web UI for a Raspberry Pi can display extended session statistics, including burned calories. The session data can be synchronized between the smartwatch and the Raspberry Pi using a Bluetooth connection.
